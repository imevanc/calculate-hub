      content: `What are percentages?

Percentages are a way of expressing fractions or ratios as parts of 100. The % symbol stands for 1/100, making it easy to compare different quantities on a common scale. Understanding percentages is fundamental to many mathematical and real-world applications.

Basic calculations

Converting between fractions and percentages involves simple mathematical operations:
- Fraction to Percentage: Divide the numerator by the denominator, then multiply by 100
- Percentage to Fraction: Place the percentage number over 100, then simplify if needed

Real-world examples

Percentages appear everywhere in daily life: tax rates, discounts, test scores, statistical data, and financial calculations. For example, a 20% discount means you pay 80% of the original price, or 4/5 of the total cost.`,

      title: "Types of Percentage Calculations",
      content: `Simple percentages

Basic percentage calculations involve finding what portion one number represents of another. For instance, if 15 out of 20 students passed a test, that's 15/20 = 0.75 = 75%.

Percentage change

Percentage change calculations show how much a value has increased or decreased relative to its original value. This is commonly used in financial markets, population studies, and performance metrics.

Compound percentages

Compound percentages involve multiple percentage applications, such as calculating interest that earns interest, or applying multiple discounts consecutively. These calculations often require more complex formulas and understanding of exponential growth or decay.`,

    applications: {
      title: "Practical Applications",
      content: `Finance and investing

Percentages are crucial in finance for calculating interest rates, investment returns, loan payments, and portfolio performance. Understanding percentage calculations helps in making informed financial decisions and comparing different investment options.

Statistics and data

Statistical analysis heavily relies on percentages to present data meaningfully. From survey results to scientific studies, percentages help communicate findings clearly and allow for easy comparison between different datasets.

Everyday scenarios

Daily life applications include calculating tips at restaurants, determining sale discounts, measuring cooking ingredient ratios, understanding weather forecasts, and interpreting test scores or grades.`,

      title: "Advanced Concepts",
      content: `Percentage points

Percentage points are used when comparing two percentages directly. For example, if unemployment rises from 5% to 7%, that's an increase of 2 percentage points, not a 2% increase (which would actually be a 40% relative increase).

Compound interest

Compound interest involves calculating interest on both the principal amount and previously earned interest. This creates exponential growth over time and is fundamental to understanding long-term investments and savings.

Error margins

Error margins in statistics represent the uncertainty in measurements or survey results. When the numerator represents the difference between true and observed values and the denominator represents the true value, the fraction to percentage formula becomes the percent error formula.`,
    },
    tips: {
      title: "Tips and Tricks",
      content: `Mental math shortcuts

Learn common fraction-to-percentage conversions: 1/2 = 50%, 1/4 = 25%, 3/4 = 75%, 1/5 = 20%, 2/5 = 40%, etc. These benchmarks make quick estimations easier and help verify calculator results.

Common mistakes

Avoid confusing percentage increase with percentage points. Remember that 50% of 50% is 25%, not 100%. When converting percentages to fractions, always place the percentage over 100 and simplify when possible.

Quick estimation methods

For quick estimates, round fractions to the nearest simple fraction. For example, 7/23 is approximately 7/21 = 1/3 ≈ 33%. Use the fraction to percentage formula: n/d × 100 = p, where n is numerator, d is denominator, and p is percentage.`,
